# Help a young woman to get her Masters in Renewable Energy (REST)

> **TL;DR;** I got accepted on an exclusive, and expensive for me,  Master's program. Although I managed to get a scholarship, I still need help to cover the initial costs such as Registration, Visa and Airfare.

Hi, my name is Júlia and I need help to be able to do my Masters in France. I an Electrical Engineering Student in a Brazilian university, [UFES](http://ufes.br), and I am expecting to graduate this August.

The Masters is offered by **[École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/)** and it lasts a year. The theme in super important for today's reality: **Renewable Energy Science & Technology (REST)** ([link](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/master-renewable-energy-science-and-technology/)).

## Background
A few months ago I applied to a Masters in the best French engineering school and never thought I would be able to be admitted. I am beyond happy because of it and more so because it is in area that I identify myself with. Another major point of my happiness is being able to help the world with the this specialization in **Renewable Energy**.

What makes me passionate about this course is the fact that this is one of the few places that has a laboratory specific for _Photovoltaics_ which enable us to have a more hands on experience on the subject.

## Costs
However, the cost of the Master per year of learning is around € 6,000, which, initially showed to be cost prohibitive without counting the cost of living in France.

## The Masters
The program is divided into 2 semesters:
* First semester: classes
* Second semester: experience in a internship - possibly paid internship

## The journey until now
Fortunately, after spamming the Master's coordinator and looking at other possibilities, I received an email saying that a company was interested in paying the price of the program for me, in another words, I was able to get the € 6,000 to cover my Masters.

## Helping
With all the help I got up to now, it is still not enough, I need to cover my cost of living and initial expenses such as Registration, Visa and Airfare. The money raised here will go towards the initial expenses, anything else if possible will go to my living costs.

I created two funding profiles, one for Brazilian contributors, and other for International contributors, if you are able to help, please use whichever is better for you.
